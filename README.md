Created as a hackathon competition project. This web app lets the users pick a location in a custom indoor multi floor map, then the app will generate a shortest path that has less number of people along the path from the users current position to their destination. (Works similarly to Waze)

Instruction to run:
- Run the main.py file
- To access the map page, add /map at the end of the url
